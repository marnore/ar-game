MaterialUI is a UI kit for Unity that follows Google's official Material Design guidelines.

Please note that this package is outdated and is no longer worked on nor supported. You can find the [shiny new version of MaterialUI on the Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51870), which is better, faster, and more feature-packed! It's also still being updated with new features and improvements.

I'd advise only using this for learning purposes, as it probably won't work well with recent Unity versions.

You can contact me at materialUI@invexgames.com, but providing support for this package isn't my top priority.
